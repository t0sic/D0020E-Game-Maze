# Game

This project aimed to create a tool to be used during an open house fair at LTU to attract new students to the Computer Science program. The fundamental requirements for the project were that it should be an online multiplayer game playable through a web browser on a mobile phone and have a spectator mode that can be displayed on a large screen. In line with this, the project has successfully created a game that meets these requirements. The game involves the following: "Players are wizards in a maze where the goal is to find a key and then make their way to a door to escape the maze." Players compete to see who can find the key and escape first. Additionally, players have various spells to prevent the other player from succeeding and taking the key from them. The game has good user engagement and is presumed to meet all the project's initial goals. By creating a tool that attracts new students to the Computer Science program at LTU and offers an engaging gaming experience, the project has not only met the initial requirements but also helped generate interest in the subject among potential students. This could have a positive impact on future student recruitment.
